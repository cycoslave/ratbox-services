This is the current stable version of ratbox-services.

-- ratbox-services-1.2.4
- properly fix --enable-mysql, which now takes the path to mysql_config
- properly fix --enable-pgsql, which now takes the path to pg_config
- make chanserv enforcing topics more consistent.  Chanserv will now enforce
  topics whenever it is in the channel.
- fix userserv::info giving parameters in the wrong order
- extend enforce_topicfrequency in chanserv {}; so that when it is set to 0,
  chanserv will enforce topics immediately rather than on a timer
- support updating topics that are different only in case
- fix a bug where keys/limits were being accidentally removed in some
  situations
- fix the handling when we get a read error from a server
- new startup options for controlling path to chroot to and uid/gid to drop
  privs to

-- ratbox-services-1.2.3
- add support for +S into ALIS
- fix permanent chanserv bans not applying to users joining a channel
- chanserv::addban and chanserv::delban no longer require the channel exists
- fix a minor buffer overflow relating to +S and ALIS.
  This affects 1.2.2 only, no other versions are affected and the impact is
  somewhat limited.

-- ratbox-services-1.2.2
- fix compilation with gcc-4.4
- chanserv will now remove bans from the channel when they expire in the
  database
- fix a potential crash by a user changing their email address with userserv
- add in support for chanmode +S (ssl-only).  rserv will now always support
  the ircd sending channel mode +S
- new general {}; conf option: allow_sslonly = <yes|no>;
  controls whether users can instruct chanserv to use the +S mode.
  This should match the ircd setting
- chanserv::set::topic will now cause chanserv to update the topic if it is
  already present in the channel
- banserv expires based on events, but this prevented a kline (etc) that had 
  just expired from being reset.  Enforce an expiry of all bans prior to
  handling a request from an oper
- chanserv { expireban_frequency }; and chanserv { expiretopic_frequency };
  were being ignored and defaults used in their place
- memoserv will now notify users when they login if they have unread memos
- OLOGIN/OPERLOGIN will now enforce usernames are correct
- fix an issue with userserv allowing usernames above the maximum length.
  It will now ignore these and warn about them on startup.

  sql injection

  last access iterate the hash in bits to stop it hogging cpu

  address rather than the new address
- fix chanserv::chansuspend to properly support suspend times
- russian translations, via
  Valery Yatsko <darkwire.tl@gmail.com>
- new banserv {}; conf option: max_kline_matches = <number>;
  controls the maximum number of clients a kline can match for it to be
  allowed
- new banserv {}; conf option: max_xline_matches = <number>;
  controls the maximum number of clients an xline can match for it to be
  allowed
- fix a problem with postgresql and banserv klines
