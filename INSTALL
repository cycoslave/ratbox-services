ratbox-services installation guide
----------------------------------

IMPORTANT: ratbox-services maintains a large amount of state in RAM.  See
doc/database_mod.txt for more information.

* MOST TABLES MUST NOT BE MODIFIED WHILST IT IS RUNNING *

1. Decide which services you dont want compiled in.  By default all 
   will be compiled in, as they can be disabled in the config file.
   These can be listed via ./configure --help

2. Ensure you have a grammar/lexical parser installed.  Bison and flex are
   recommended, though yacc and lex should do.

3. ratbox-services can use different database engines for storing the data.
   It presently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.  SQLite is the default, 
   it is a database interface to a normal file, meaning it does not require a
   seperate service to be running.  Only version 3 of SQLite is supported.

   A copy of SQLite is included with ratbox-services, you may force
   ratbox-services to use this version by passing '--with-sqlitebuild' to
   configure.

   To choose MySQL you should pass '--enable-mysql' to configure.

   To choose PostgreSQL you should pass '--enable-pgsql' to configure.

   If configure cannot find your database engine, you can tell it to look
   in a specific place.  This varies for each database:

     For SQLite:     '--enable-sqlite=PATH'.
       Configure will then look in PATH/include/ and PATH/lib/
     For MySQL:      '--enable-mysql=/path/to/mysql_config'
       Configure will use the given mysql_config binary to determine paths.
     For PostgreSQL: '--enable-pgsql=/path/to/pg_config'
       Configure will use the given pg_config binary to determine paths.

   The sqlite included here is NOT suitable for installation system wide, 
   only for building ratbox-services.

4. Run the configure script.  By default it will attempt to install to
   /usr/local/ratbox-services.  If you want it in this directory, then
   as root you must first:
   	mkdir /usr/local/ratbox-services
	chown youruser:yourgroup /usr/local/ratbox-services
   Then install as normal from your username.  Services will not run as
   root, nor should you run make install as root.


   If you wish to install it to a different directory include the 
   --prefix option:
        '--prefix=/home/user/services'

   If there are services you dont want compiled in, like the operbot,
   include the relevant option:
        '--disable-operbot'

   If your nick or topic length set in ircd are different to 9 and 160
   respectively, then:
   	./configure --with-nicklen=LENGTH
	./configure --with-topiclen=LENGTH
   where LENGTH is a number.

   See ./configure --help for more information.  Naturally, options should
   be combined so ./configure is only run once.

5. Run make

6. Run make install

7. Change to the directory it installed to.

8. Edit etc/example.conf and save it as etc/ratbox-services.conf.

9. Initialise your database, this must be done even if you are converting
   from hybserv.

   Instructions for this are contained in INSTALL.<database_backend>

   If you are converting from hybserv, see the website for further
   instructions: http://services.ircd-ratbox.org/

9. On the ircd ratbox-services will connect to, add a connect{} block (or
   C:/N:/H: lines for older ircds). This should have services's server
   name (name in serverinfo{} in ratbox-services.conf) and no autoconnect.
   send_password and accept_password should be equal and flags=encrypted
   should not be used.

10. On all ircds on the network, some configuration may be necessary.
    If you use the ratbox-services compatibility code in ircd-ratbox,
    all servers need service { name = "<ratbox-services's server name>"; };
    If you want to use BanServ, all servers need a shared{} block.

11. Run sbin/ratbox-services

12. Investigate PREFIX/bin/ircd-shortcut.pl if you wish to install command
    shortcuts for your services in your ircd, eg /chanserv etc.
