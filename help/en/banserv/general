This service allows services opers to place klines, xlines 
and resvs on all servers which accept bans from services.
These bans can be temporary or permanent and can be synced
to servers.

Temporary bans accept the tokens w/d/h to mean weeks, days, 
and hours.  These may not be combined, so "1w" is valid, but
"1w1d" is not.
