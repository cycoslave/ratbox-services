-----------------------------

Opers can interact with services over IRC, and those with the dcc flag in
their operator {}; may also have a DCC session with services.

Opers may login over IRC via the command "OLOGIN".  This command is accepted
by every service, and takes the form:
	/msg <service> ologin <username> <password>

You may also log out of services via the command "OLOGOUT".

Opers with the dcc flag may initiate a DCC to any service, or have services
initiate a DCC to the client via:
	/ctcp <service> chat

When logged in over DCC, various flags can be set via the ".flags" command,
and there is a 'partyline' to chat to other logged in opers.
