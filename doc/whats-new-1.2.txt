General
-------
- Support for translations of helpfiles and messages from services.

Userserv
--------
- userserv::set::noaccess added.  When this is set, the username cannot be
  added to any channels.
- userserv::set::nomemos added.  When this is set, the username cannot
  be sent memos through memoserv.
- userserv::usersetemail added.  A new command for administrators that
  allows them to change a usernames email address.
- userserv::usersuspend extended.  There is now support for suspending
  a username temporarily for a given duration.

Chanserv
--------
- chanserv::set::nouserbans added.  When this is set, all bans set on a
  channel must be done through services.
- chanserv::op extended.  Now when a specific channel is not give as a
  parameter, the user will be opped in all channels that they are currently
  not opped in.
- chanserv::chansuspend extended.  There is now support for suspending a
  channel temporarily for a given duration.

Operserv
--------
- Ability to make services ignore all messages from a given nick!user@host
  mask.
- Ability to merge services into operserv.  The banserv, jupeserv and
  watchserv services can now be 'merged' into operserv which will remove
  them as separate services and provide support for using their commands
  through operserv instead.  Helpfiles are automatically merged.

  Note, when using service merging, the config files should stay the same
  as they would when not merging services.  The loglevel and flags of the
  service are taken from operserv however.

Banserv
-------
- Ability to add regular expression matches.  When a client connects to the
  network they are compared against the regular expressions and if they 
  match services will issue a kline for their hostname.

Memoserv
--------
- A new service allowing usernames to send memos to each other.
