  IMPORTANT: You must move your configuration files for them to work
  with the new directory structure.  After installing this version,
  you should move your config file and db file to:
  	PREFIX/etc/ratbox-services.conf
	PREFIX/etc/ratbox-services.db

- services privs are now far more fine grained

  IMPORTANT: If you expect to have any admin access to your services,
  you must redo your privs per operator {};.  See example.conf for
  details.

  their nickname to the one they wish to regain

- tidy up tsinfo updates
- add CHANSERV::CHANLIST and USERSERV::USERLIST, to list registered
  channels/usernames

  configure
