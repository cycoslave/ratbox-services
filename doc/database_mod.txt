-     ratbox-services 'live' databases    -
-------------------------------------------

ratbox-services maintains a large amount of database state in RAM, instead
of performing lookups in the database.  This means that most of the database
cannot be modified whilst ratbox-services is running, as ratbox-services
will not recognise the changes.

The following tables in the database are 'live', and can be modified
externally without issues:
	operbans
	users_resetpass
	users_resetemail
	channels_dropowner
	email_banned_domain

All other tables must not be modified whilst ratbox-services is running.  If
you need to do this (ie, for a web interface), then you should look at the
database hook API, documented in dbhook.txt.  This allows the usage of
'syncer' tables, to notify ratbox-services it needs to modify the database.

Current database hooks are listed in dbhook_current.txt
