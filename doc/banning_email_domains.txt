-   Banning email domains  -
----------------------------

When using the email functions with ratbox-services, it is possible to
prevent certain email domains from being used in email addresses.

This table cannot be modified from within ratbox-services, but runs live
from the database.  Wildcards are not supported.

The database table is 'email_banned_domain', which contains a single field
of 'domain'.  To add an entry, simply add it into this table via the
appropriate SQL method.

Eg, to ban emails using the domain 'ircd-ratbox.org':
	INSERT INTO email_banned_domain (domain) VALUES('ircd-ratbox.org');
