ratbox-services upgrade guide
-----------------------------

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 1.0.x, YOU MUST READ THE DBMOVE FILE.

If you are upgrading between major version numbers (eg, 1.0.x -> 1.1.x), you
should read doc/whats-new-VER.txt.  This file will document the major
changes between the versions.

When upgrading between versions, you should run the dbupgrade.pl script
found in tools/.  This script will output the list of database changes
since a given version, for a given database schema.

Your database should only be upgraded after you have terminated the old
version, but before you have started the new version.

This upgrade script only accounts for released versions, not for subversion
copies.

This upgrade script *cannot* cope with moving between different database
backends.

You should always run the upgrade script with your full version -- keeping
any "beta", "rc" tags etc.

The script is run as:
	./dbupgrade.pl <version> <schema>
Eg,
	./dbupgrade.pl 1.0.3 sqlite


If you are upgrading from the 1.0.x series, you must read the DBMOVE file.
